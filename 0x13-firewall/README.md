A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The primary goal of a firewall is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet, to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

There are several types of firewalls, each with its own strengths and use cases:

Packet Filtering Firewalls: These firewalls examine data packets and filter them based on predefined rules. They work at the network layer (Layer 3) and are often used in routers.

Stateful Inspection Firewalls: Also known as dynamic packet filtering firewalls, they keep track of the state of active connections and make decisions based on the context of the traffic.

Proxy Firewalls: These intermediaries act on behalf of the client and server, forwarding traffic and providing an additional layer of security. They can inspect traffic at the application layer (Layer 7).

Application Layer Firewalls (ALGs): These firewalls focus on the application layer and are designed to work with specific applications and services, offering granular control.

Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW): NGFWs combine traditional firewall capabilities with additional security features like intrusion detection and prevention, deep packet inspection, and application awareness.
